# A driving force analysis method for drought-flood abrupt alternation events
Ecological Informatics
## Project Overview
This repository contains DFAA event characteristic data, DFAA time series chart data, DFAA driver analysis results, as well as code for calculating SWAP indexes, code for extracting DFAA events, and code for Pettitt mutation tests.
## Folders
### DFAA_data:
Includes spatial distribution maps of the mean occurrence intensity, average duration, and event frequency counts of both DTF and FTD eventsï¼›Standard deviational ellipse calculation results for both DTF and FTD events  
### DFAA_driving_factors_data:
Includes the detected change-point days of driving factors identified through Pettitt's test, MGWR results, and spatial distribution patterns of dominant DFAA factors  
### Relevant_code:
Includes the SWAP index calculation code, DFAA event identification code, and Pettitt mutation test code  
### Table_data:
Stores time series data of impact extent and intensity for both DTF and FTD events; Time series data of SWAP index and precipitation for representative years
