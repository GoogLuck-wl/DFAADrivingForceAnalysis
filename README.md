# A driving force analysis method for drought-flood abrupt alternation events
Ecological Informatics
## Project Overview
This repository contains DFAA event characteristic data, DFAA time series chart data, DFAA driver analysis results, as well as code for calculating SWAP indexes, code for extracting DFAA events, and code for Pettitt mutation tests.
## Folders

DFAA_driving_factors_data: 包括Pettitt突变检验得到的驱动因子出现的突变时间，DFAA主导因子的空间分布
Relevant_code: Includes the SWAP index calculation code, DFAA event identification code, and Pettitt mutation test code
Table_data: Stores time series data of impact extent and intensity for both DTF and FTD events; Time series data of SWAP index and precipitation for representative years"
